# Run the calculations

Detailed information on the files here are given in [this file](../../Readme.md). There is an extra CP2K input file for xTB compared to DFT calculations which 
computes the OT wavefunction as an initial guess for the diagonalization. You can submit the calculations in multiple jobs by 
running `python distribute_jobs.py`.
