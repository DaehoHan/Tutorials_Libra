    "Below, we will be using `step3.run_step3_sd_nacs_libint` function to compute the time-overlaps and nonadiabatic couplings between excited states basis. This can be done either in the many-body or single-particle basis. A schematic of the workflow for selecting new active space is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some parameters are common with the ones used to run `step3.run_step3_ks_nacs_libint(params)` above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other parameters needed to run the `step3.run_step3_sd_nacs_libint(params)` function are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`params['isUKS']`: A boolean flag for unrestricted spin calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "`params['is_many_body']`: If set to `True`, the NACs will be computed between pairs of many-body (TD-DFT) states. Also, the NACs between single-particle \n",
    "SDs obtained from the TD-DFT results will be computed as well. Otherwise, only single-particle NACs will be computed only for the SDs obtained from\n",
    "`num_occ_states` and `num_unocc_states`. This will be used for xTB calculations in which no TD-DFT was performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`params['number_of_states']`: The number of TD-DFT states to consider. This value should not exceed the number of requested TD-DFT states in the CP2K\n",
    "calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "`params['tolerance']`: A lower bound for selection of the excitation with configuration interaction coefficients higher than this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "`params['verbosity']`: An integer value showing the printing level. The default is set to 0. Higher values will print more data on the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "`params['sorting_type']`: After defining the SDs, Libra will sort them either based on `'energy'` or `'identity'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The NACs can also be computed between excited states. These include the single-particle and many-body bases which the latter is obtained from the\n",
    "TD-DFT calculations. First, we need to compute the overlap between excited state Slater-determinants (SDs) then they will be used to compute the NACs\n",
    "between them. For many-body states, the configuration interaction coefficietns will be used. We will consider both single-particle \n",
    "and many-body for DFT calculations but only single-particle for xTB.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways of defining the excited states SDs (the single-particle excited state basis). The first is through \n",
    "defining the `num_occ_states` and `num_unocc_states` in which Libra\n",
    "will start making the SDs from all of the occupied states (starting from `HOMO-num_occ_states+1`) to all of the unoccupied states (ends\n",
    "to `LUMO+num_unocc_states-1`). Also, if the unrestricted spin calculation flag is set to `True`, the SDs will be made for both alpha and beta spin channels. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want to build the electron-only excitation basis, you need to set `params['num_occ_states'] = 1` and set `params['num_unocc_states']`\n",
    "to a value less than the number of unoccupied orbitals that was considered in the computation of overlaps. This will generate all the electron-only\n",
    "excitation from HOMO to unoccupied states.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the TD-DFT calculations has been done, then Libra will go over all log files and \n",
    "generate all the SDs used for all the steps and therefore the definition of these SDs is automatic and Libra will replace the `num_occ_states` and\n",
