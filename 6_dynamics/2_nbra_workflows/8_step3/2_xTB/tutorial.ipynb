    "\n",
    "`params['number_of_states']`: The number of TD-DFT states to consider. This value should not exceed the number of requested TD-DFT states in the CP2K\n",

    "\n",
    "`params['tolerance']`: A lower bound for selection of the excitation with configuration interaction coefficients higher than this value.\n",

    "`params['verbosity']`: An integer value showing the printing level. The default is set to 0. Higher values will print more data on the terminal.\n",

    "The NACs can also be computed between excited states. These include the single-particle and many-body bases which the latter is obtained from the\n",

    "will start making the SDs from all of the occupied states (starting from `HOMO-num_occ_states+1`) to all of the unoccupied states (ends\n",
    "to `LUMO+num_unocc_states-1`). Also, if the unrestricted spin calculation flag is set to `True`, the SDs will be made for both alpha and beta spin channels. \n",
