This tutorial demonstrates running the scattering calculations with 
general type of non-adiabatic molecular dynamics using various methods
and various model Hamiltonians 

* `recipes.py` - pre-defines the NA-MD methods to run

* `run_namd_2state_models.py` - the main execution part - it does the main heavy-lifting

* `plot_2state_models.py` - use to plot various detailed calculations for each given set of calculations

* `analysis.py` - analyzes the results of many calculations, to compute the scattering probabilities for 
   different initial conditions



* `tutorial.ipynb` - is a Jupyter analog of the above Python files.
