This tutorial demonstrates the Gaussian kernel algorithm, which finds a smooth approximation
to the probability density of a random set of points. This is something one may be using in
many-interacting-worlds (MIW) theory to compute the Bohmian-like dynamics.

This example is for 1D and uses the Voronoi tessellation for computing approximate probability densities.
