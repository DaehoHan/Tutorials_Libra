* Enumerate every sub-folder in each given folder. The number should be a part of the name of each sub-folder, for instance
  "1_rigid_body", "1_setup". Don't use UPPER_CASE or Camel_Case

* Use minimal descriptive folder name in a given hierarchy of folders - e.g. "1_rigid_body/1_setup", not 
  "1_tutorial_rigid_body/1_rigid_body_setup" - in this case "tutorial" is excessive in the first level, and
  "rigid_body" is redundant in the second level
 
* Use the all-lowercase-and-underscore file and folder names, for instance "1_rigid_body", not any of these:
  "1_Rigid_body", or "1_Rigid_Body", or "1_RIGID_BODY", or "1-rigid-body"

* Each tutorial (the Jupyter notebook and data files) should be placed in a separate folder
  so that any output generated by running the example is not mixed up with the output of other tutorials

* Every master tutorial (in each of these folders) should be named "tutorial.ipynb"

* Every final folder should include a "README.md" file describing the content of the corresponding folder
  and its content, potentially needed additional preparation/setup instructions

* Every finale folder's "README.md" should have a link pointing to the top-level "README.md"
