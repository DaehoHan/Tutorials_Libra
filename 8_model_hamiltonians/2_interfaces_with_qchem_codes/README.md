This tutorial demonstrates how "compute Hamiltonian" via interfacing with external quantum-chemistry codes

To run the tutorial, you will need 

* tutorial.ipynb - the tutorial file

* dftb_input_template.hsd - a template file for the DFTB+ related calculations

* halorg-0-1 (not privided here) - the Slater-Koster files for halogen-organics, need to download it from the DFTB.org website
